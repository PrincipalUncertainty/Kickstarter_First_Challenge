# Kickstarting with Excel
This project utilized data in a kickstarter file to enhance and improve a data array and consider analysis and challenges of this kickstarter to learn lessons to improve future decisions with regard to campaign donation goals and theater launches in order to identify trends for best yields and outcomes..
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to assess a variety of outcomes based on data relevant to questions informing future actions to enhance financial and successful artistic performances
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis of this data was accomplished after some adjustments due to combined data in some columns.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This analysis visualized campaign outcomes ("successful," "failed," and "cancelled") based on the launch date. 

A key takeaway identified in this analysis is that May launch dates yielded the greatest number of successful outcomes, followed closely by June, July, and equally Feb., Apr, and August.

Alternatively, launch dates Nov. through Apr. yielded the least amount of failed outcomes; however, May through Aug. (and October) showed the highest rate of failed outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This analysis visualized campaign outcomes based on financial goals of the performances, specifically the "plays" subcategory, where it was identified that projects had a decreasing rate of success as the financial goals increased and likewise an increasing rate of failure that peaked between 20000 and 24999 dollars. However, the data show an interesting trend reversal between 30000 and 39999 dollars where the percentage of successful campaigns is notably higher than failed campaigns

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The analysis of this data was accomplished after some adjustments due to combined data in some columns, however the real difficulties emerged with the data being representative of ongoing performances rather than any repeated data points that could point to more essential influencers in the data set.
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
See Analysis
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
See Analysis
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This dataset provides ample data but this analyst would like to see more repetitive productions during different months year after year.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
There are so many
